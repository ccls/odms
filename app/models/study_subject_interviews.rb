#
#	Simply extracted some code to clean up model.
#	I'd like to do this to all of the really big classes
#	but let's see how this goes first.
#
module StudySubjectInterviews
def self.included(base)
#	Must delay the calls to these ActiveRecord methods
#	or it will raise many "undefined method"s.
base.class_eval do

	has_many :interviews

#	#	Returns home exposures interview
#	def hx_interview
##		interviews.find(:first,
##			:conditions => { 'projects.id' => Project['HomeExposures'].id },
##			:joins => [:instrument_version => [:instrument => :project]]
##		)
#		interviews.joins(:instrument_version => [:instrument => :project]
#			).where('projects.id' => Project['HomeExposures'].id).first
#	end

end	#	class_eval
end	#	included
end	#	StudySubjectInterviews
