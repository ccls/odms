#	The StudySubject is the heart of our little application.
#	It contains a ridiculous number of associations, validations,
#	delegations, etc.  I am trying to organize it all, but due
#	to the volume, this may be a bit challenging.  I am trying to
#	group code related to specific associations into their own
#	files in hopes of making it simpler to follow.  In addition,
#	there are matching test classes.
