It appears that the "newer" classes know how to compare with the "older" ones, but not vice versa, which makes sense.

My comparisons in Sample should just have the "newer" class, the *_at field, first and compare it to the "older" *_on field.  OR convert the DateTime to a date.  Comparison of a Date to a DateTime will be confusing as it doesn't just compare the date, it takes the time zone into account which isn't 100% obvious.  I think that it converts it to UTC before comparing.  This could effectively make the comparison incorrect.

YES.  Add a "to_date" to the _at fields.


>> Time.now
=> Tue Mar 06 20:00:06 -0800 2012
>> Time.now.class
=> Time

>> Time.zone.now
=> Wed, 07 Mar 2012 03:54:31 UTC +00:00
>> Time.zone.now.class
=> ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone

>> Time.zone.now > Date.today
=> true

>> Date.today < Time.zone.now
ArgumentError: comparison of Date with ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone failed
	from (irb):49:in `<'
	from (irb):49

>> Date.today < Time.now
ArgumentError: comparison of Date with Time failed
	from (irb):50:in `<'
	from (irb):50


Also, even if the *_at field is given a Date value, it will be typecast to ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone so there is no terrible need to update all of the tests.
