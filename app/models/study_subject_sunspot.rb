#	Simply extracted some code to clean up model.
#	I'd like to do this to all of the really big classes
#	but let's see how this goes first.
#
module StudySubjectSunspot
def self.included(base)
#	Must delay the calls to these ActiveRecord methods
#	or it will raise many "undefined method"s.
base.class_eval do

searchable do
	# fields for faceting or explicit field searching
	string :subject_type
	string :vital_status
	string :case_control_type
	date :reference_date
	string :sex
	date :dob
	date :died_on
	string :phase
	integer :birth_year       #	actual birth_year attribute or parse year from dob???
	# fields for text searching
	# ALL ids and names
	# enrolled projects
	# sampleids
	# Phone numbers
#	string :biospecimens, :multiple => true
end if Sunspot::Rails::Server.new.running?
#
#	This condition is temporary, but does mean
#	that the server must be started first.
