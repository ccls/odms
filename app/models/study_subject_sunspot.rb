Dynamic Fields

I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m the only person who ever uses this feature of Sunspot, but just in case, let’s look at a real-world example. Let’s say part of my data model uses free-form key-value pairs, which use a constrained (but user-definable) set of keys and free-form values. I’ll call my model KeyValuePairs.

The trick I would like to pull here is that I would like to treat each key as a separate field in search, so that I can constrain, order, facet, etc. on the values for one key without them being affected by other keys. Since the keys are user-defined, I can’t just set up normal fields at build time; they need to be defined at index time. Enter Sunspot’s dynamic fields (we’ll use Sunspot::Rails’s wrapper API here):

class Business < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :key_value_pairs


  searchable do
    dynamic_string :key_value_pairs do
      key_value_pairs.inject({}) do |hash, pair|
        hash.merge(pair.key.to_sym => pair.value)
      end
    end
  end
end

This sets up a dynamic field which is populated using the given block. What’s important there is that the field is populated using a hash - the keys of the hash become individual dynamic fields, and the values populate those fields in the index. The “base name” of the field is key_value_pairs, which is used to namespace the dynamic names that come out of the hash.

Working with dynamic fields is a lot like working with regular ones, except in the query, calls are wrapped in a dynamic block:

Business.search do
  dynamic :key_value_pairs do
    with(:cuisine, 'Sushi')
    facet(:atmosphere)
  end
end

Naturally, those field names (:cuisine, :atmosphere) wouldn’t be hard-coded in a real application, since they would not be known at build time.
