#
#	Simply extracted some code to clean up model.
#	I'd like to do this to all of the really big classes
#	but let's see how this goes first.
#
module StudySubjectAbstracts
def self.included(base)
#	Must delay the calls to these ActiveRecord methods
#	or it will raise many "undefined method"s.
base.class_eval do
#
#	has_many :abstracts
#
#	def abstracts_the_same?
#		raise StudySubject::NotTwoAbstracts unless abstracts.count == 2
#		#	abstracts.inject(:is_the_same_as?) was nice
#		#	but using inject is ruby >= 1.8.7
#		return abstracts[0].is_the_same_as?(abstracts[1])
#	end
#
#	def abstract_diffs
#		raise StudySubject::NotTwoAbstracts unless abstracts.count == 2
#		#	abstracts.inject(:diff) was nice
#		#	but using inject is ruby >= 1.8.7
#		return abstracts[0].diff(abstracts[1])
#	end
#
end	#	class_eval
end	#	included
end	#	StudySubjectAbstracts
