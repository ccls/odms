#	Simply extracted some code to clean up model.
#	I'd like to do this to all of the really big classes
#	but let's see how this goes first.

module StudySubjectSubjectType

#	Must delay the calls to these ActiveRecord methods
#	or it will raise many "undefined method"s.
base.class_eval do

	attr_protected :subject_type

	#
	#	As this attribute shouldn't ever be changed, I haven't created
	#	the "standard" subject_types method.
	#
	#	This method is predominantly for a form selector.
	#	It will show the existing value first followed by the other valid values.
	#	This will allow an existing invalid value to show on the selector,
	#		but should fail on save as it is invalid.  This way it won't
	#		silently change the subject types.
