#	in rails 3, this no longer includes the initial key, which seems odd

setting will put it back, but I've modified the javascript already
so may not be needed

could put this in config/environment.rb
ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json = true

or something like this in config block in config/application.rb
config.active_record.include_root_in_json = false
