	adding :headers => true is supposed to set a flag in the file 
	somewhere marking it as having a header row, but I don't 
	think that it actually does.

	also, use a - with the ruby closing tag to avoid extra lines in csv file.

I added leading spaces to the sampleid and subjectid so that excel preserves 
the leading zeroes by treating the field as a string rather than integer.
