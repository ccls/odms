	adding :headers => true is supposed to set a flag in the file 
	somewhere marking it as having a header row, but I don't 
	think that it actually does.

	also, use a - with the ruby closing tag to avoid extra lines in csv file.

	Unfortunately, when Access imports a csv file it adds a type to columns, I think.

	The hospital_no is treated like an integer.  If it gets too big or contains
	a non-digit character, it just leaves the field blank.  This is an absolutely
	awful idea.  Thanks again Microsoft.  Because of this, I force quotes.
	I really only need to quote the hospital_no, but it is easier to just quote them all.

I added html_safe to stop any html encoding just in case
