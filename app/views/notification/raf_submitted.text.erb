For consented patients, please use this ID number for labeling all biological samples and paperwork (i.e. RAF, consent, CBC report) to be returned to the CCLS office and for all future correspondence regarding this patient.

If this patient has refused or is ineligible for the CCLS, please retain this ID number for tracking purposes.
