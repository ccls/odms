<h3>Review Possible Duplicate Subjects</h3>
<div id='possible_duplicates' class='raf_section'>

<p>The following existing subject(s) may be matches for the new case.  If so, please select the correct subject and press "match found."  Otherwise, press "no match."</p>

<table><thead>
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>&nbsp;</th><th>treating institution</th><th>admit date(temp)</th>
<th>hospital number</th>
<th>birth date</th><th>sex</th><th>study ID</th><th>child ID</th></tr>

<%= render :partial => 'raf/duplicate', :collection => @duplicates,
	:locals => { :f => f } %>

NOTE to self.  Be advised that pressing enter on a text field will submit
	the form using the FIRST submit button on the form.  This will now
	be the "Match Found" submit button.  I don't know if there is a
	way to set the "default" submit button on a form.  There is no standard
	defined for this behaviour although I could add some javascript that
	intercepts the keypress and "clicks" on the .default submit button.
	No idea whether this would fly across OS and browsers though.  It should
	as it would be jQuery which is supposed to handle all that jazz.

	I think that it may be better to NOT use multiple buttons, but rather
	have a radio button in the list for NO MATCH.  

	I need something to determine whether the form is ...
		... acknowleding a match
		... acknowleding no match
		... just resubmitted as noticed a typo or something

$(function() {
    $("form input").keypress(function (e) {
        if ((e.which && e.which == 13) || (e.keyCode && e.keyCode == 13)) {
// I don't think that 'button[type=submit]' is correct for me as
// it should just be an 'input[type=submit]'
            $('button[type=submit] .default').click();
            return false;
        } else {
            return true;
        }
    });
});




	Or, perhaps a better solution.  HIDE all of the form except
	the duplicates section so that the text fields aren't visible
	and therefore the user can't press enter from within them.			#	This is my chosen solution.
