	Somewhere along the line someone, hpricot I believe, redefines to_xs
	which raises ...
	ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 0)
		from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/builder-3.0.0/lib/builder/xmlbase.rb:135:in `to_xs'
		from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/builder-3.0.0/lib/builder/xmlbase.rb:135:in `_escape'
		from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/builder-3.0.0/lib/builder/xmlbase.rb:140:in `_escape_quote'
	
	I can't find the redefinition in the code, but it could be compiled.

	If we simply redefine it again back to the way it is in Builder 3.0.0

	/usr/lib/ruby/user-gems/1.8/gems/builder-3.0.0/lib/builder/xchar.rb

	Putting this here actually causes Builder to complain,
	however, putting it in the rake task seems to work! Yay!
