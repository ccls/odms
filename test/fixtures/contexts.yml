#	Do not change id or key
#		'id' could be referenced by existing data
#		'key' is used in the rails code for searching

#	Be Advised.  Yaml fixture labels MUST BE UNIQUE.
#		If a label is repeated, only the last one will exist.

#	Read about fixtures at http://ar.rubyonrails.org/classes/Fixtures.html

#	I don't think that anything will ever explicitly reference
#	a context so the id could probably be removed.  This 
#	will generate an id based on a hash of the label (big random number).
#	I don't particularly like it, but can be convenient.

addresses:
  id: 1 
  key: addresses 
  description: address combo boxes in ODMS 
phones:
  id: 2 
  key: phones 
  description: phone number combo boxes in ODMS

#	currently, both addresses and phones are the same
#	DataSource filter.  Will they always be the same?
#	Should I merge them?  Or leave it be?
