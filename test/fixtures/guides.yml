    CCLS does not maintain a phone number history.  Only current phone numbers are kept in the system.

    A subject may have multiple current addresses and phone numbers to accommodate work, mailing and residential information.
    
    New addresses and phone numbers may be added by clicking the "add new" link under the last item listed in each section. 
    
    Corrections to current addresses and phone numbers may be made by clicking the edit link to their right. 
    
    *Note:* Although the system maintains a history of addresses, edits to modify current records are destructive -- that is, *we do not keep a history of the old information once it has been changed*
    
    Addresses in the history are not editable in this system.  If a correction must be made to an address that is not current, please notify a system Administrator.

    Hospital/Medical information exists for case subjects only.  

    

    To find medical data for a control's associated case subject, click on "Related Subjects" at left and click on the case subject listed there.  Once in the case subject's record, you can navigate to their hospital/medical screen for more information.

    

    For patients...

    

    *Admit/Reference Date*

    Only Case Subjects have an Admit Date.  However, this date is used as a point of reference for many study operations regardless of subject type so a Reference Date exists for all subjects.  Admit date and Reference date are always identical.

    

    *Diagnosis Date*

    Diagnosis date is provided during medical record abstracting.  It may or may not be the same as the admit date.

    *terminated participation* -- the study subject terminated participation after having begun for some reason other than change in eligibility.  (i.e., multiple attempts to complete a phone interview fail)

    **Samples** -- dust samples collected as part of the Home Exposures study are managed in this section.  The landing page only shows subjects who have completed the Interview.

    **What does "don't know" mean?**  Use don't know when you have specifically reviewed hard copy and other CCLS documentation and have determined that we don't have the answer to the question.  Otherwise, leave the response blank.
    
    **What's the difference between 'valid' and 'current address?'**
    
    When we learn specifically that an address for a subject is no longer good or conversely is accurate, we indicate either by changing the valid? setting.  
    
    If the address is bad, we may not be sure why -- we just know that we can't reach the subject there.  In that event, we set valid? to "No."  On the other hand, if we know it's invalid because we have learned that a subject has moved, we set both valid? and "current address" to "no".  
    
    For example, a newsletter is returned as undeliverable (valid? = no) but we receive an address service post card from the USPS with a new address (current address = no', new address added in system).  
    
    **Examples**
    
    Birth Certificate address:  valid? "yes" (from a known, reliable source); verified? "yes" (known, reliable source); current address? blank or "don't know"; address at diagnosis: blank or "don't know"
    
    RAF addresses:  valid? "yes", verified? "yes" (provided by respondent at diagnosis), current address? "yes", address at diagnosis? "yes"
    
    subject moves:  valid? "yes", verified? "yes" (because we only know a subject has moved when we've received some sort of notification), current address? "yes" (for new address, change old address to "no"), address at diagnosis? "no" 
    
    address of unknown origin (existing addresses, addresses from SRC with no supporting info, etc.):  blank or "don't know" for all responses until such time as an interviewer or other staff member has verified the address information or determined it is invalid.
    
    **More Guidance**
    
    **Address Type:**  If adding a new residence address for an existing subject, please be certain to change any previous residence addresses so that "Current Address" = "No."  Except in rare instances, subjects should have only one current residence.
    
    **Valid?:**  Have we learned that attempts to contact subject at the address shown fail; e.g., a letter been returned by the postal service.  Or we have confirmed unequivocally that it is accurate; e.g., an Interviewer verified the address with a respondent.  
    
    If the address is invalid, an explanation is required (e.g. "newsletter returned as undeliverable").  This is used in conjunction with "current address" when a subject moves.  (See above for explanation.)
    
    **Verified?:**  If the address has been verified by some mechanism, indicate that it has by checking this box and providing specifics.  Examples: "USPS address service card received," "interviewer confirmed address with respondent," etc.
    
    **Current address:**  A respondent may have more than one current address.  However, that is to permit tracking of a current residence, current mailing address, current work address, etc.  If a respondent changes residence, however, be sure to change "current address?" to no for the previous address.
