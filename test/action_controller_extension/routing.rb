#	Apparently, when using the asset pipeline, this routing error
#	will not get raised.  I don't know why just yet.  The request
#	will actually get passed to the controller without regard
#	for whether the route exists.
#	Some get kicked to the Calnet login screen.
#	Some raise AbstractController::ActionNotFound
#
#	rake routes doesn't list the route
#
#	Perhaps its is better to just search for the route?

#puts "#{[verb,action,args].join(', ')}"

#	enabled asset pipeline
#	HOWEVER, now, for whatever reason, all of my expected 
#		ActionController::RoutingError tests fail as the routes
#		exists?  I'm confused as to why that should happen.
#		And its not like the request is sent to some assets controller
#		or even my pages controller catch.  It goes to the
#		associated controller!!!!
#	Fortunately, this does not appear to be the case in reality.
#	Non-existant routes are still non-existant, but not in testing
#
#	Before asset pipeline, it never made it this far ...
