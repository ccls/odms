#
#	Capybara.default_drivers [ :rack_test, :selenium/:selenium_firefox, 
#		:selenium_chrome, :selenium_safari, :webkit ]
#
#		Unfortunately, each driver has different abilities and limitations.  
#			We cannot develop for all of them.  We must choose.
#			I chose capybara-webkit ( or just webkit ).
#
#		Capybara.default_driver = :rack_test
#			This is the default driver, but does not support javascript.  
#			This is effectively the same as webrat, although the DSL is a 
#			bit different.  Webrat is still used a bit, but as these
#			integration tests are primarily used to test javascript, 
#			all of my new tests are capybara based and do not use rack_test
#
#		Capybara.default_driver = :selenium	#	defaults to firefox
#			This is a decent tester, but will actually open a browser window
#			which you can watch.
#			selenium can interact with alert/confirm pop-ups...
#				press Cancel by ...
#					page.driver.browser.switch_to.alert.dismiss
#				press OK by ...
#					page.driver.browser.switch_to.alert.accept
#			selenium can also check the content of this window...
#				page.driver.browser.switch_to.alert.text
#
#		Capybara.default_driver = :selenium_firefox
#			:selenium_firefox does not exist, but could be defined with ...
#				Capybara.register_driver :selenium_firefox do |app|
#					Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, :browser => :firefox)
#				end
#			This is effectively the same as :selenium, as firefox is its default.
#			I have found a bit of a catch when using this on my MacBook Pro.  
#			There is a bit of a problem with using the firefox binary, which 
#			includes both 32 and 64 bit versions, on a 32-bit machine.  The 
#			64-bit code must be removed. I ...
#				cd /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/
#				ditto --arch i386 firefox-bin firefox-bin-leopard-dittod
#			This results in the requirement to specify this new binary to 
#			be used with ...
#			if( Socket.gethostname == "mbp-3.local" )	#	jake's home machine
#				Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Binary.path=
#					'/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin-leopard-dittod'
#			end
#			In addition, to use any selenium, the following is required...
#				require 'selenium/webdriver'
#
#		Capybara.default_driver = :selenium_chrome
#			In order to test with chrome, the chromedriver must be downloaded.  
#			It is just a single file, and must placed in the path.  Without 
#			it, you will see ...
#				Selenium::WebDriver::Error::WebDriverError: 
#					Unable to find the chromedriver executable. 
#				Please download the server from 
#					http://code.google.com/p/chromium/downloads/list and 
#				place it somewhere on your PATH. More info at 
#					http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver.
#			As this driver does not exist, it will need to be defined/registered with ...
#				Capybara.register_driver :selenium_chrome do |app|
#					Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, :browser => :chrome)
#				end
#			In addition, to use any selenium, the following is required...
#				require 'selenium/webdriver'
#
#		Capybara.default_driver = :selenium_safari
#			There is no safari driver, so can't test in safari.  If there were, ...
#			Capybara.register_driver :selenium_safari do |app|
#				Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, :browser => :safari)
#			end
#
#		Capybara.default_driver = :webkit ( capybara-webkit )
#			I have chosen to use webkit.  It requires a bit more installation, 
#			but is cleaner.  There are also a few things that do not work, 
#			mostly with respect to the alert/confirm pop-up windows.
#			We cannot use switch_to for alert/confirm windows with webkit, 
#			as was done with selenium. We also cannot test the content
#			of an alert/confirm pop-up window.
#			webkit seems to automatically click ok on alert and confirm
#			pop-ups.  In order to override this and click 'Cancel',
#			something like ...
#				page.evaluate_script('window.confirm = function() { return false; }')
#			can be used.
#			In order to use webkit, qt4 must be installed before the gem.  
#			On a mac, ...
#				port install qt4-mac
#				gem install capybara-webkit
#			Instructions say to set the javascript_driver, but when I did, 
#			it made no difference.
#				Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit
#			Instead if I set the default_driver, it runs ..
#				Capybara.default_driver = :webkit
#
#			webkit and selenium do not support transactional fixtures as they 
#				are in different threads and therefore do not share a database 
#				connection between the test and the browser.  A patch for this 
#				is to force a single database connection for each model.  
#				It works, but is more of a hack.
#			

#
#	new ssl implementation method raises issues
#
#Capybara.register_driver :webkit do |app|
##	Capybara::Driver::Webkit::WebkitInvalidResponseError: Unable to load URL: https://127.0.0.1:57186/fake_session/new
##  Capybara::Webkit::Driver.new(app, :ignore_ssl_errors => true)
#  Capybara::Driver::Webkit.new(app, :ignore_ssl_errors => true)
#end
Capybara.default_driver = :webkit
Capybara.default_wait_time = 1	#	set this small for testing leftovers

#	Using class_attribute instead of mattr_accessor so that
#	each subclass (read model) has its own value as we have
#	two databases meaning not all models have the same connection.
#
#	If not using transactions, this is no longer necessary????
#
#class ActiveRecord::Base
#	class_attribute :saved_connection
#	def self.connection
#		saved_connection || retrieve_connection
#	end
#end




# Transactional fixtures do not work with Selenium tests, because Capybara
# uses a separate server thread, which the transactions would be hidden
# from. We hence use DatabaseCleaner to truncate our test database.
DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
#	This REALLY SLOWS down the integration tests.
#	Truncates after each test and reloads all fixtures before hand
#	This adds about 2 or 3 seconds to each integration test
#	The other option is :transaction, but is effectively
#	the same as before using DatabaseCleaner.  And is not very good at it.
#
#	Just learned that if using :transaction, would need a
#	DatabaseCleaner.start somewhere.  In the setup, perhaps?
#
#
#	apparently, can list tables here for truncating
#
#  DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation, {:only => %w[widgets dogs some_other_table]}
#
#  DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation, {:except => %w[widgets]}
#
#	I think that all of the fixtures would still reload though
#
#	As is, seems to be working a treat




#	by creating separate subclasses, rather than just extending IntegrationTest, 
#	we can use both webrat and capybara.  We only use capybara now.
class ActionDispatch::CapybaraIntegrationTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest


#	NOTE
#	old school is ActionController::IntegrationTest
#	new hotness is ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
#	don't know of any issues, yet anyway


	# Stop ActiveRecord from wrapping tests in transactions
	self.use_transactional_fixtures = false
#
#	By turning off transactions, I could just manually cleanup everything.
#	This would probably be faster as I would only clean the things that
#	need cleaning.
#
	#	if were using :transaction strategy, would need to ...
	#	setup :start_database_cleaner_transaction
	#	def start_database_cleaner_transaction
	#		DatabaseCleaner.start
	#	end

	teardown :call_database_cleaner
	def call_database_cleaner
		# Truncate the database
		DatabaseCleaner.clean
		# Forget the (simulated) browser state
		Capybara.reset_sessions!
		# Revert Capybara.current_driver to Capybara.default_driver (just in case)
		Capybara.use_default_driver
	end


#	Capybara-webkit uses actual http server.  This server runs in a different thread.  This thread has a difference connection and therefore a different transaction.  In order for the test server and the http server to be aware of the other's doings, they must be "shared." 
#
#	OR, apparently, just don't use transactions. This will be slower as the database can not be rolled back.  It must be cleaned and repopulated.  This will take about 2 seconds per test. That's the theory anyway.  I'm about to test it.


#
#	If not using transactions, this is no longer necessary????
#
#	setup :synchronize_selenium_connections	#	this includes :webkit
#	def synchronize_selenium_connections
#		#	if driver is selenium based, need to synchronize the transactional connections
#		#
#		###	initially based on http://pastie.org/1745020, but has changed
#		#
#		#		class ActiveRecord::Base
#		#			mattr_accessor :shared_connection
#		#			@@shared_connection = nil
#		#			def self.connection
#		#				@@shared_connection || retrieve_connection
#		#			end
#		#		end
#		#		# Forces all threads to share the same connection. This works on
#		#		# Capybara because it starts the web server in a thread.
#		#		ActiveRecord::Base.shared_connection = ActiveRecord::Base.connection
#		#
#		###
#		#
#		#	connection hack for selenium
#		#	with selenium, the database connection from the test and from the controllers 
#		#		are different and as the connections are transactional, I think, the test 
#		#		will be unaware of changes that the controller makes and the controller 
#		#		will be unaware of changes that the test makes.  This seems to be why 
#		#		creating a user in the test does not result in a user being found in the 
#		#		controller.  The same goes for the user's roles.  It also means that the 
#		#		tests will not notice a difference after creating a page or other resource 
#		#		in the controller.  So.  Apparently, we need a hack in all the models that 
#		#		will do this. Normally, we could just hack AR::Base, but since we already 
#		#		have 2 connection (one for shared, one for the app), we can't (unless I 
#		#		find a new way)
#		ActiveRecord::Base.saved_connection = ActiveRecord::Base.connection
#	end
