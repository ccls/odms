#	everything into a single regexp.

#	Adds a file mapping, optionally prepending the mapping to the front 
#	of the list if prepend is true. regexp should match a file path in the 
#	codebase. proc is passed a matched filename and Regexp.last_match.

#	Don't use any punctuation in test names.  The test name gets split on them and
#	then won't get rerun when called as that test isn't, or may not, exist.



#	FYI, "complex" pluralized names in fixtures don't get mapped correctly.
#		counties, people, etc.


#	Another FYI.  Recently, autotest no longer runs the tests in alphabetical order.
#	It seems that the tests are run in the order that the files are loaded?
#	How is this controlled?
