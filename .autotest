#	everything into a single regexp.

#	of the list if prepend is true. regexp should match a file path in the 
#	codebase. proc is passed a matched filename and Regexp.last_match.

#	FYI, "complex" pluralized names in fixtures don't get mapped correctly.

#	Another FYI.  Recently, autotest no longer runs the tests in alphabetical order.
#	It seems that the tests are run in the order that the files are loaded?
#	How is this controlled?
