#	try upgrading capybara
#	try upgrading mocha?

#	try removing minitest
#
#	I think that this is needed because of CommonLib
#	it load ActiveSupport::TestCase which loads its dependencies.
#	See if can only do this in test environment.

#	Thought that I fixed this, but someone is still trying to load it?
#	Seems to only be required in the console?

#
#	Gonna have to leave it I guess

#
#	The presence of MiniTest trips a condition in the test method 'pending'
#	When it exists, it tries the 'skip' method which for some reason does
#	not exist and so fails, but only in 'rake test'.  'autotest' works???
