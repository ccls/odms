#	rubygems > 1.6.2 is EVIL!  If you update, you deal with it.
#		generates all kinds of new errors and deprecation warnings
#		somehow loads older versions of gems, then bitches when you try to load the newest.
#		(may be fixable with "gem pristine --all --no-extensions", but haven't tried)
#	rake 0.9.0 caused some errors.  can't remember
#	arel > 2.0.2 caused some errors.
#	some gem versions require rails 3, so have to use older versions
#		authlogic, will_paginate


#	buffler and clic now have their own Gemfiles
#	so the special mods for jruby are no longer needed.
