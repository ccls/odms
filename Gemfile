Remaining 4.2 update issues

Sunspot not starting right away on my MacBook.  Need to wait a minute or so
otherwise will get many "Errno::ECONNREFUSED: Connection refused" errors.


#	Old "versions" migration files being run somehow causing this.
# Test database is occassionally being created wrong? Non-null constraint being added?
#ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: Mysql2::Error: Column 'mail' cannot be null: UPDATE `users` SET `displayname` = 'Mr. Jake Wendt, BA', `sn` = 'Wendt', `mail` = NULL, `telephonenumber` = '+1 510 642-9749', `updated_at` = '2016-01-15 14:25:11' WHERE `users`.`id` = 69



assert_select does not work the same with regular expressions in 4.2 as 4.1 did.
